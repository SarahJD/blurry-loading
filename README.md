# Blurry Loading

This is a blurry loading image. When you come to the page, the image starts bluring and the loading text goes up from 0 to 100%, until the image comes into focus.

In the JavaScript I mapped different number ranges: the opacity of the loading text versus the blur effect of the image.

This is the 5th project from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
